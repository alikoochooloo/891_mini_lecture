# 891_mini_lecture

This program is a demonstration for the mini lecture in the 891 Autonomous vehicles course at MSU.
It uses python turtle library to create two turtles that roam around the window and if they go beyond the bounds of the window you lose and the game will stop.
The black turtle is more aggressive and will move by 50 pixles in each movement but the gray turtle only moves 15 pixles.
Black can be controled by up, down, left, and right keys.
Gray can be controled by the w, s, a, and d keys.
There is a autopilot function available for either turtle which keeps it in the middle of the window.
The autopilot key for the black  is z and for gray is x.
The atopilot for gray turnes off 15-25 seconds.
The autopilot for black turnes off after 30-40 seconds.
When there is 2 seconds left of the autopilots you will hear a intermittent chime.
The point of this code is to show how you can get distracted by one turtle, lose control of the other turtle, and lose the game.
The games is an attempt to simulate driver distraction and autopilot handoff in autonomous vehicles.
